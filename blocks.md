##Strings, dates and links

The string block can be used to display a small amount of text on the frontend. This is great for titles and bylines.

###Text blocks

The text block is used for larger amounts of text that do not require the WYSIWYG editor. Additional formatting can be added manually through the admin.

###Date blocks

The date block allows the end-user to select a date from an interactive calendar. This is useful for making changes to the date on an article, or event.

###Link blocks

Link blocks are primarily used to store URLs, this is useful for managing social media links and "read more" buttons.

##Gallery

The gallery block is great for showing off work to your audience.
