Making Changes

You can then go to the "Themes" menu item in the admin of your site, select your theme (mytheme) and click 'Review and Update'.



This will then show you a list of all the blocks the system has found within your templates. Any blocks in green will be new blocks to Coaster. You can review the block type guesses and change by using the dropdown - the system will guess the block type based on the name of your block using the following array:

  $typesArr = [
            'video' => ['vid'],
            'text' => ['text', 'desc', 'keywords', 'intro', 'address', 'html'],
            'richtext' => ['richtext', 'content', 'copy'],
            'image' => ['image', 'img', 'banner'],
            'link' => ['link', 'url'],
            'datetime' => ['date', 'datetime'],
            'string' => ['link_text', 'caption', 'title'],
            'form' => ['form', 'contact']
        ];
After you are happy with the block types and labels (for the admin fields), click Update at the bottom of the table and your templates and blocks will be saved to Coaster.

It will also scan for types of blocks within the themes/[mytheme]/blocks/repeaters folder so that repeating content blocks will be available to your users on the templates you have included them on.

You can review/change update the block types from here at any time.
